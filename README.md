# Go API client for qrz

This document describes the interface specification for access to QRZ's XML subscription data service. This service provides real-time access to information from the QRZ.COM servers and databases.
Access to this service requires user authentication through the use of a valid QRZ.COM username and password. While any QRZ user may login to the service, an active QRZ Logbook Data subscription is required to access most of its features. Non-subscriber access limits the data fields that are returned and is primarily intended for testing and troubleshooting purposes only.
A description of subscription plans and rates is available on the [QRZ website](http://www.qrz.com/i/subscriptions.html).
